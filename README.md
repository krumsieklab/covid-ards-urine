# Urine-based multi-omic comparative analysis of COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis-induced ARDS

This repository contains scripts for the analysis and figure generation of the paper<br/> **Batra\*, Uni\* et. al.** Urine-based multi-omic comparative analysis of COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis-induced ARDS (2022), *Medrxiv*.

# Content

Execute scripts in order. The code will first compute all result tables and then generate the paper figures. For script 4, a running Cytoscape session is required to generate the network files.

| **Script name**                  | **Description**                                                        |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1_between_ards.R         | Molecular comparison of the two ARDS groups for all omics layers   |
| 2_within_ards.R          | Molecular signatures per clinical manifestation in each ARDS group |
| 3_figure_1.R             | Generates Figure 1                                                |
| 4_figure_2.R             | Generates Figure 2                                                |
| 5_figure_3.R             | Generates Figure 3                                  |
| custom_functions.R       | Internal functions, will be sourced by other scripts               |
